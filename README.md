# cute koishi
 Breaking down a discord meme using Python

This link shows up cute koishi in discord, but when open in a browser, rick roll on youtube appears. If you download the full image, a cursed version shows up since it's an animated png with two frames.
The code will download the picture instead of getting redirected to youtube.
